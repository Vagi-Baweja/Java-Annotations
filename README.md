# Java-Annotations

Certainly! above is an example of how you could define your own custom annotations @ThinkingMachines and @Institute in Java:
In this example:

@ThinkingMachines is a custom annotation that can be applied to classes, methods, or fields. It signifies that the annotated element is related to thinking machines.
@Institute is a custom annotation that can only be applied to classes. It represents the institute associated with the annotated class.

In the above example, @ThinkingMachines annotation is used to annotate both the class NeuralNetwork and its field processingUnit, providing additional information about their relation to thinking machines. The @Institute annotation is applied to the class abcd, indicating the institute associated with it.
